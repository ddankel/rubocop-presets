  # What version of Rails is the inspected code using?  If a value is specified

  # as a float (i.e. 5.1); the patch version of Rails should not be included.
  # If TargetRailsVersion is not set, RuboCop will parse the Gemfile.lock or
  # gems.locked file to find the version of Rails that has been bound to the
